A car racing game based on Slick with a simple physics engine and three different AI players

# What is this game?
This game is a kart racing game where one player races against computer-controlled enemies to be the first one to the finish. The player controls Donkey, who is skilled at picking up various items found on the road to use or throw at his opponents. The goal of the game is to reach the finish line first, by any means necessary. 
In this game, the “world” is a two-dimensional grid of tiles. While the map is designed as a narrow track, the player is able to drive freely around the world (but of course, the player cannot drive on trees, mountains, water, and other types of terrain)
